* The following are ideas that can be implemented moving forward:
1. Utilize the data obtained from the scraper in a predictive model
2. On the Front End:            
    a. Add a GUI to allow the user to search for a specified number of job postings for a specified job field 
3. On the Back End:                  
    a. Connect to an API to allow for the productionisation of the model
